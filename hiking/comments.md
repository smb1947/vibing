C1: I want to make one thing clear. The order of importance is as follows: user mentioned preferences, then hike-log, then default values. Make this explicit in the instructions.

(Ignore) C2: Add preferences list from this AllTrails article <https://support.alltrails.com/hc/en-us/articles/37227964040852-How-to-use-filters-to-find-trails>

C3: Write python code to build the rankings.
