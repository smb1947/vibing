Hi folks! Welcome to Week 4 of our pilot AI Product Builders Series. On Wednesday we'll meet again in Founders 490, the Innovation Lab. We expect to have a special guest or two to cheer you on. 

Please come prepared to talk about your project, whatever shape or status it's in. Below is a suggested outline to follow - even if you didn't get all the way to something you can demo, answer the questions you can. This is NOT a formal presentation; this will be a casual, safe environment. Don't sweat it. You're welcome to share your portfolio page if you've created one. 

Demo Day: How to Frame Your Product (5–7 minutes)
1. The problem (30–45 sec)
Who is this for?
What’s the specific pain point you’re solving?
How do people solve this today—and why is that frustrating or inefficient?
Prompt: “What moment made you think, there has to be a better way?”
2. Your product & core use case (1–2 min)
What did you build?
What is the primary job it helps a user do?
What’s the one feature that matters most?
Prompt: “If this product only did one thing well, what would it be?”
3. Live walkthrough (2–3 min)
Show the happy path
Narrate your thinking as a PM, not just what’s on the screen
Call out where AI/no-code is doing real work vs. glue work
Prompt: “What decision did you make here—and what tradeoff did you accept?”
4. What changed through iteration (1 min)
What was your first version?
What feedback or testing changed your approach?
What did you cut or simplify?
Prompt: “What did you learn that surprised you?”
5. What’s next (30 sec)
If you had two more weeks, what would you build next?
What’s the biggest risk or open question?
Prompt: “What would you test before investing real resources?”


What we’re listening for:
Clear problem framing
Evidence of iteration and judgment
Comfort with ambiguity
Bias toward action over perfection
