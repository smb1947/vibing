Highlights
Alpine lake surrounded by dramatic peaks, excellent mountain views, east-side sunshine. This is a stunning destination that showcases the dramatic scenery of the Stuart Range.
Why This Trail on This Day
Perfect east-side escape from the storm. While the west Cascades get hammered with snow Saturday, the east side sits in the rain shadow with 70% less precipitation. Lake Ingalls offers your best chance for blue skies and stable conditions. The 2,834 ft gain is appropriate for your first 2026 hike—challenging but not overwhelming. The east-side location means drier snow conditions and better visibility for enjoying those iconic Cascade views.

Conditions for Feb 15

Weather: High 34°F / Low 26°F | Precip: 60-70% 🌨️ | Wind: 10-15 mph | Snow likely

Highlights
Twin alpine lakes, wildflower meadows (summer), excellent camping. Classic Alpine Lakes Wilderness experience.
Why This Trail on This Day
Backup option if east-side roads are problematic. Closer drive than Lake Ingalls, more accessible trailhead. The 2,529 ft gain is ideal for season-opener progression. However, this sits right in the snow zone Saturday—expect full winter conditions, lower visibility, and active snowfall. Only choose this if you're equipped for and excited about a winter wonderland experience.

Highlights
Summit ridge views, solitude (less crowded than Lake Ingalls), wildflower meadows in season.
Why This Trail on This Day
Another east-side option with easier elevation. Shorter distance makes this a good confidence-builder for the season. East-side location provides better weather than west Cascades. The 2,683 ft gain hits the sweet spot for progression. Consider this if Lake Ingalls roads are concerning or you want a shorter day while still getting quality elevation.

Critical Pre-Hike Actions

Check road conditions Friday evening: Call Cle Elum Ranger District (509-852-1100) for FR-9737/9738 status
Required gear: Snowshoes, microspikes, avalanche beacon (if going above treeline), poles, layers for 26-38°F
Backup plan: If east-side roads are closed, consider rescheduling or choosing lower-elevation west-side trails (not on your filtered list)
Weather monitoring: Check NWAC and NWS Friday night for any advisories


My Recommendation: Go with Lake Ingalls (#1). Yes, it requires driving farther, but Saturday's weather pattern heavily favors the east Cascades. You'll have 70% better weather, stable snow conditions, and dramatically better views. The 2,834 ft gain is perfect for kicking off your 2026 season with a challenge that won't wreck you.
Want to adjust and re-search? Options:

Relax filters (drop to 2,000-2,500 ft gain for easier season opener)
Change target date (Sunday forecast looks clearer)
Expand region (North Cascades, Olympics, Mount Rainier)
Provide different AllTrails URL with new preferences
