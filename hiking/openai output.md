I ran the `trail-picker` workflow on your URL using fallback extraction + live NWS data for **Saturday, February 14, 2026**.

I had to use **Round 1 relaxation** (`max duration 6h`) because only 2 trails survived at the default 5h cap.

## 1. Mount Walker Trail

**Location**: Hood Canal (Quilcene)  
**Distance**: 5.0 mi | **Elevation Gain**: 2,135 ft | **Difficulty**: Hard  
**Estimated Duration**: 4.6 hrs

**Access**

- **Drive from Greenlake**: ~2.1 hrs
- **Road**: Highway access open; trail access generally sedan-friendly (recent WTA report notes muddy trail, not road closure)

**Logistics**

- **Pass Required**: None found
- **Group Limit**: Unavailable

**Conditions for 2026-02-14**

- **Weather**: High 43F / Low 31F | Precip 56% | Wind ~7 mph | Rain/snow likely
- **Trail**: Muddy/slippery in latest report window (older than 14 days, so partially stale)
- **Snow Level**: ~1,837–2,756 ft forecast (regional) | Trailhead ~650 ft | **Safe at trailhead**

**Why this trail this day**

- Best duration fit under your filters, strong elevation challenge, and trailhead stays below forecast snow level.
- Weather is mixed, but exposure/logistics are still manageable versus higher Olympic options.
